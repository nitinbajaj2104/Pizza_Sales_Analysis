The best selling pizza is the Classic Deluxe Pizza, followed by the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Hawaiian Pizza wheras the Brie Carre Pizza accounts for the lowest share in total sales of the business.

## Recommendations

On the basis of the insights drawn from the analysis of the pizza sales , various measures or steps can be taken by the business to improve their sales and make it more profitable .

The business might want to consider hiring more staff on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights to cope with the increased demand. It can also offer and adopt various sales promotion techniques or methods from sunday to wednesday such as providing discount coupons, adopting schemes such as buy one get one free  to increase the sales volume as the sales on these days of the week is the lowest .

Appropiate modifications or changes can be made in the ingredients or taste of The Brie Carre Pizza so that its sales can be increased . The reasons for less sales revenue share in the total sales of The Brie Carrie Pizza can be analysed by comparing it to the best selling pizzas  like The Classic Deluxe Pizza with respect to its price and other attributes.
